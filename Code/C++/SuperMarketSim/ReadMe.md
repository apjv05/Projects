## How to make a Supermarket File
To use a pre-made supermarket, type "supermarkets/filename.txt" - replacing fulename.txt with the supermarket of your choosing. You can load in a custom supermarket using the following template below or load in a pre-made one from the supermarkets folder. Once you make your supermarket, I would recommend putting it into the supermarkets folder - just for organization.

### General Template
