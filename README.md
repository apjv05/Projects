# My Repo

## Project Collection
Welcome! This repository contains a collection of coding projects I've built while learning and experimenting with programming concepts, algorithms, and technologies. Each folder contains the source code and optionally a README with more specific instructions.

## Projects

Each project is stored in its own directory. Here's a brief overview:

    sudoku_solver â€“ Randomly generates a sudoku board and solves it with a backtracking algorithm.

    Supermarket Simulator - simulates managing products, customer checkout, supermarket members, and employee management.

## Purpose

This repo serves as:

    A portfolio of my work and learning progress.

    A sandbox for testing new ideas or tools.

    A place to improve through building, breaking, and iterating.
